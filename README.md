## public archive
This is now a public archive for people.

Due to 2 reason's:

## reason's to the cancellation
EIT (Creator of this) is an asshole & backstabed me.

(He basically shutted the entire thing down without TELLING ME, and got pissed at the fact I was semi inactive with my scheduacle)

I gave permission to someone to take this down

## my final message
Anyway's, I guess I am now in ownership of this.

Rest in piss, PE-Tutorial's.

I will not publically put an archive notice.

Do whatever the hell you want with the code if you credit me & EIT.

Feel free to make a PR.

## revival notice's
Also, I please beg you NOT to make a revival of this.

Let this project fucking rot in hell.

## continuation
I do not support what EIT has done.

Any revival's I see. I am taking it down <3
